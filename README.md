## About Me
 * Iâ€™m currently working on a project involving a MariaDB and a JAVA frontend. The project is still very early in development but once it's in a usable state I'll be publishing the repository.
 * I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student.
 * In my free time I build computers and dabble with programming projects.
